# Soccer-Salaries-Python-

Identifying Undervalued Soccer Players (or a more specific title)

Description:

This Jupyter Notebook explores a dataset of soccer players using Python and Pandas to identify potentially undervalued talent for acquisition or contract renegotiation. It focuses on analyzing salaries (wages) and estimated market values to find players who might be underpaid relative to their perceived worth.

Technologies:

Python
Pandas
Seaborn, Bokeh for visualizations
Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Wrangling:
Handle missing values.
Convert data types for salaries and market values (e.g., remove currency symbols, convert to numerical format).
Ensure data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Analyze the distribution of salaries and market values to understand trends and identify outliers.
Calculate the difference between market value and salary to assess potential undervaluation.
Identifying Undervalued Players:
Create visualizations (scatter plots, etc.) to explore the relationship between salaries and market values.
Analyze players with a significant difference (high market value, lower salary) as potential acquisition or contract renegotiation targets.

This project demonstrates skills in:
---------------------------------------

Data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas.
Exploratory data analysis to uncover insights from sports data.
Identifying undervalued players based on salary and market value comparisons.
